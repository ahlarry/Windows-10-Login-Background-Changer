## Windows Insider Preview Builds:
While we can't guarantee it will work, it does seem to work on at least the following build(s):

* 10525

## The Team
The project was founded by Krutonium, though he hasn't done much on it in a while;  
The project has been completely overhauled and revamped by Toyz, much to Krutoniums' delight;  
The project has been helped immesely by darth62969, since Krutonium and Toyz are busy and bug reports take time;  
The project is happy to have anyone who joins add themselves here;  
The project is alive ;)  

## Notes
* **Very light colors makes the username and email hard to see. Be careful with lighter colors.**
* **Some antivirus programs detect this as a virus, so turn it off (temporarily) before you start this program!**
* **Requires Visual Studio 2013 Express for Desktop or better to open the .sln file.**
